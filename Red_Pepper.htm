One Christmas Eve, a small boy and his two little sisters hung their stockings by the fireplace and went to bed, wondering what they would find in the morning. They had happy dreams, awoke early, jumped out of bed and ran to the fireplace. To their delight, their stockings were chock-full. The little girls found candy, gum, handkerchiefs, and lovely dolls. The boy took a big orange from the top of his stocking, then pulled out a whistle and blew it; a jew's harp and played a tune on it; a top and how that top did spin. In the very toe of the stocking, he found a toy elephant. He loosened the key and wound it up. <BR>
Now, what do you suppose that elephant did?<BR>
It ran all around the room, then into the pantry. It climbed up on the shelves, where there were all kinds of good things to eat.<BR>

Said the toy elephant to itself, "I'll make a lunch and go on a picnic."<BR>
So it made some bread and butter sandwiches, some peanut butter sandwiches, some lettuce sandwiches, some meat sandwiches, and then it made some red pepper sandwiches.<BR>
Said it to itself, "My but those red pepper sandwiches look good." It put them all into a basket, tied the basket to its tail and ran out the back door. It ran along a path that led through the woods, and the three children followed it on and on, until it came to an open place where a great tree, reaching away up into the sky, grew in the center.<BR>
Said it to itself, "Here's where I'll have my picnic."<BR>
The little folks climbed into a tree not far away, perched high up on the branches, and watched that toy elephant.<BR>
It sat down on the green grass, with the basket beside him. It ate a bread and butter sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich, a lettuce sandwich, a meat sandwich, and then it ate a red pepper sandwich.<BR>
Oh Gosh, Gee Whittiker, Holy Smoke, but the toy elephant was hot. It let out a yell. It rolled over on its back and pawed the air. It stood on his head, fell on his feet, and ran off howling and howling. It's running and howling yet.<BR>
Then a great lion came along and saw the lunch. He sat down on the green grass with the basket beside him.<BR>
Said he to himself, "My, but those red pepper sandwiches look good, I'll save them for dessert". He ate a bread and butter sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich, a lettuce sandwich, a meat sandwich, and then he ate a red pepper sandwich.<BR>
Oh Gosh, Gee Whittiker, Holy Smoke, how that lion roared. He roared and ran, he ran and roared. Gee whiz, he's running and roaring yet.<BR>
A giraffe came walking along, eating the leaves high up on the trees. Looking down he saw the lunch. He sat down on the green grass with the basket beside him.<BR>
Said he to himself, "My but those red pepper sandwiches look good, I'll save them for dessert". He ate a bread and butter sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich, a lettuce sandwich, a meat sandwich, and then he ate a red pepper sandwich.<BR>
Oh Gosh, Gee Whittaker, Holy Smoke, he coughed and sneezed so hard that he tied his long neck into a tight knot. He ran through the woods like wild, but he was a wise giraffe; he came back and ate another red pepper sandwich, then coughed and sneezed so hard that the knot came out.<BR>
A sly old fox saw the lunch and sat down on the green grass, with the basket beside him.<BR>
Said he to himself, "My but those red pepper sandwiches look good, I'll save them for dessert". He ate a bread and butter sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich, a lettuce sandwich, a meat sandwich, and then he ate a red pepper sandwich.<BR>
On Gosh, Gee Whittiker, Holy Smoke, he slipped silently away with his eyes watering. He came back with a monkey.<BR>
The monkey sat down on the green grass with the basket beside him.<BR>
Said he to himself, "My but those red pepper sandwiches look good, I'll save them for dessert." He ate a bread and butter sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich, a lettuce sandwich, a meat sandwich, and then he ate a red pepper sandwich.<BR>
Oh Gosh, Gee Whittiker, Holy Smoke, when that monkey yelped and yelled, the sly old fox slunk into the woods and split his sides laughing.<BR>
Then a big black rooster with a red comb came stepping along, pecking here and pecking there. When he saw the lunch, he sat down on the green grass with the basket beside him.<BR>
Said he to himself, "My but those red pepper sandwiches look good, I'll save them for dessert." He ate a bread and butter sandwich, a peanut butter sandwich, a lettuce sandwich, a meat sandwich, and then he ate a red pepper sandwich.<BR>
Oh Gosh, Gee Whittiker, Holy Smoke, he flew to the very top of the high tree, and called "Cock-a-Doodle-Doo, Cock-a-Doodle-Doo" so loud that all the birds flew away, the wild animals scampered out of the woods, the squirrels scooted to their nests, and even the snakes sneaked into dark places to hide. Then the rooster flew down and laid a big red egg.
