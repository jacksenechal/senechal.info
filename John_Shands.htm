John Shands was a son of William Shands and Nazareth Robbards. John was a well educated man as shown by the several legal documents which he prepared and signed. He was also a very well-to-do man. Legal documents showed that he and Elizabeth made a number of purchases and sales of land. In addition, in the will of his grandfather, John Robbards, he was given his grandfather's "Otterdam Swamp Farm", a large tract. He died with no written will. Elizabeth was named as administratix of his estate. John and Elizabeth had two daughters and one son, John II, who was mentioned in the will of his grandfather William Shands.
