<P>
Polly was the daughter of Stephen and Mary Wilson.  She married Abraham Shands about 1810.
She had two older sisters, Catherine and Frances, who married Anthony Shands (Abraham's 
half brother) as his first and second wives. In 1816, when his sons were five and two years old, Abraham died.<BR><BR> 
Left with two fatherless sons, Polly remarried to Henry Toal, and had four more children. 
Abraham's sons Almeran and HJ ran away from home to live with relatives when HJ was ten. 
Polly remained close to her son, HJ, and accompanied him to Texas after the Civil War.</P>
