<P>
Joseph Thompson's parents names are not known. His father was a ship owner in Belfast. Apparently, Joseph and his father quarrelled, and Joseph left home for Liverpool. Joseph became a ship's captain, then a chandler and a ship owner, like his father.<BR> 
His first marriage to Elizabeth Smith ended with her death. He remarried to Elizabeth Ackers and had 6 children. When wooden sailing ships began to be replaced by iron steam ships, Joseph's business began to fail. So he retired and with four of his sons, sailed to California, about 1880. He left behind his wife, one daughter and one son. <BR>
Pirrie sold his several ships in San Francisco and bought a ranch near Eureka. After two years, he gave up ranching and bought a sawmill in Kansas City. Disaster struck with a bank failure, the death of his youngest son, Alfred, and the news of his wife's death in England. It is unclear what he did after that, but it is said that he remarried and had another family.
