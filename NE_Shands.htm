Ninus Eugene (NE) Shands was a son to Hilliard Judge Shands and Melissa Boydston Penry.<BR>
He was born on November 23, 1848; died on April 10, 1926.<BR> 
NE came of military age just as the Civil War ended, thus escaping the fighting. After 
travelling to Texas with his family at the close of the war, he studied medicine at the 
Louisville, Kentucky Medical School. In 1875, he married Julia Cox Douglass in Kaufman, Co. Tx. 
They lived in Forney, Texas, where NE practiced medicine.
