Nell Constance Thompson was born in Kenora, Ontario,
Canada in 1887.  When she was a teenager, her parents,
Pirrie and Janet Thompson, moved the family to
Everett, Washington where Nell married William Carlyle
Kantner, M.D., in 1913. Together they had one child,
Helen Constance Kantner. Will died in France during
World War I, where he had gone to assist in the field
hospitals.  Nell was thus a Gold Star Wife.

Although she had graduated from college prior to her
marriage, after the death of her husband she pursued
her education receiving two master's degrees from the
University of Washington.  While raising Helen she was
a teacher, a principal, and eventually was appointed
the Director of Vocational Education for the State of
Washington.  Upon her retirement the Olympia Home
Economics Association established the Nell C. Kantner
Scholarship.

Friends and colleagues described her as "very charming
and delightful", and admired her "graciousness" and
her "wide reaching influence" on the education of
young girls.  Her granddaughters, Barbara, Susan and
Priscilla loved her very much.
