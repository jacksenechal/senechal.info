<P>
Julia Bell Shands was the daughter of Ninus Eugene Shands and Julia Cox Douglass.<BR>
She moved in 1904 with her family from Forney to San Marcos TX. She entered Southwestern University at age 16, and upon graduating in 1904 she became a high school Englixh teacher. In 1914 she enrolled in Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA, where she received a Master's degree. There she met William Francis Thompson. They were married in San Marcos on Sept. 26, 1915, and returned to Palo Alto. Their first child, Will Jr., was born there in 1916; Janet was born in Long Beach CA in 1918; Betsy in Pacific Grove, CA in 1920, and John in San Pedro CA in 1923. They settled in Seattle, WA in 1925, and built a handsome house in the residential area called Laurelhurst. They lived there at 3621 43rd NE for over 40 years. The house was sold in 1966 after the death of Will Thompson.<BR>
Julia Bell was active in community affairs and in the life of a Univ. of Washington faculty wife. She became an excellent amateur botanist and gardener. In her later years she did extensive genealogical research and contributed much information to the genealogies of the Douglass and Shands families. She had a bright intelligence and an even temperament. She raised her children to be honest and tolerant, and they loved her as a mother and good friend. Her son- and daughters-in-law also loved and respected her.
