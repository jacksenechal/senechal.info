Wiliam Shands was the only (known) child of Thomas Shands and Frances Harrison. Born about 1685 in Sussex Co., Va., he died sometime before 17 August, 1759, when his will was probated in Sussex Co.<BR>
<BR>
William became a prosperous landowner. He received a land grant of 250 acres in Sussex County from King George in 1722. He was given a tract of land in Prince George's Co., Va. by his father. And there is another deed for land recorded to William in Surry Co., Va. in 1727.<BR>
<BR>
William married Nazareth Robbards and had six children. When William's will was written, his sons Thomas and John had died. The will named his son William II as heir to all of his estate that "lies south of the road as it now lies", and his grandson John Shands II as heir to all of the estate "that lies north of that road". Also to John II, he willed the remainder of the land tract named "Wise's", "not mentioned to his son William".  He also mentioned John Shands' wife Elizabeth and willed that she should stay on the land left to John II during her widowhood.<BR>
