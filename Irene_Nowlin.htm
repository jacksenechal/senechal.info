Irene Nowlin was the eldest daughter of Michael II and Elizabeth (Lizzy) Thompson. <BR>
Her father moved the family to Michigan in the early pioneer days. She was educated in a log 
school house with a big fireplace, where they put on a huge log in the evening "for the comfort 
of the following day".<BR>
She was a leader in her circle and a best speller in the spelling match. She became a teacher 
and taught two years. Afterward, she married Joseph Brewster Mott, August 17, 1845 in Concord, Jackson Co, Mich. They raised a large family of children, all of whom are teachers in literary and musical lines. Irene Nowlin Mott's history was one of tact and energy and force of character. Her leading traits are evidence of a generous and noble disposition.<BR>
