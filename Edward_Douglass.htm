Edward Douglass was a Scottish immigrant to America. The story goes that three Douglass brothers came to  America shortly before 1740. It is unknown what happened to the others.<BR>
Edward and Sarah moved their family from Virginia to Chatham Co., NC in 1767, and settled near Guilford Court House. Edward and his sons took part in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) under Gen. George Washington. There are references in the family history to Colonel Edward Douglass, though no detail is furnished.<BR>
After the war, the family moved to the western territory of NC, which later became Tennessee, settling in Gallatin, Sumner Co. The Douglass family became influential leaders in early Tennessee affairs, though much is attributable to Edward's children, one of whom was Edward, Jr. and is often confused in the history with Edward Sr.
