Betsy married at 14. She and Harry went to MO in 1842, to Osceola on the Osage River. Later, "in 1858 the Douglass family including their slaves, thirty in number started for Texas" (TCD).  In 1863, after five years in Sherman, Texas, they moved to Garden Valley, Texas. Then in 1869, they moved to a farm three miles north of Kaufman, Texas on the old Terrell road. Six of their eight sons fought in the Civil War. Thomas and James were too young to go.
