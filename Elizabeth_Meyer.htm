The Meyer family moved to Atwater, MN when Johann was there. Elizabeth and Johann married, and  farmed in Atwater until 1890. They filed on a homestead in Todd County, MN which they occupied and improved for seven years. Then they sold that property and bought a farm in Swift County, MN. About five years later, in 1902, they went to North Dakota and purchased 320 acres in McHenry County, ten miles north of Drake, ND. where they stayed.
