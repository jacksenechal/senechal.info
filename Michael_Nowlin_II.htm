Michael Nowlin II served in the war of 1812, being present at the retaking of Fort Niagara and Buffalo. He worked two years constructing the Erie Canal, and later kept a hotel for 8 years in Alleghany Co., NY. He was also a teacher, a justice of the peace, and a farmer. He moved with his family to Pulaski Township, Jackson Co., Mich. in about 1834. They were of the earliest settlers and organizers of that township. He interested his brothers and sisters in the Territory of Michigan, helping them get a start there. In 1842 he was Township Clerk, an office held in 1845 by James Nowlin, in 1857 by Levi Nowlin, and in 1869 by Lorenzo Nowlin.
